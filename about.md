# About

I decided to use a pseudonym for this blog post. In the 'Cancel Culture' we live in nowadays some things are are considered objectionable for talking about or questioning. This blog will include posts that many may object to because they question 'accepted norms'.

If we look at a matrix proposed by Paul Graham in an [essay on conformism](http://www.paulgraham.com/conformism.html) I have plotted roughtly where I set as a red dot (towards right hand end ~ in between passive and agressively independent minded).

I don't believe in sheepishly accepting 'the truth' when there is sufficient evidence to counter 'the truth'. :-)
