# References questioning a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2

The list below includes preprint articles and blog posts by microbiologists which question the accepted natural origin theory for the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 genome.  Segrete and Deigin (2020) note the research that considers “a possible artificial origin for SARS-CoV-2 are censored as they seem to support conspiracy theories.” However they comclude that “researchers have the responsibility to carry out a thorough analysis, beyond any personal research interests, of all possible causes for SARS-CoV-2 emergence for preventing this from happening in the future”.  Futher Relman (2020) writes “A deliberative process for investigating the origins of this pandemic must be representative of all relevant disciplines, expertise, and stakeholders; must achieve political neutrality, scientific balance, and access to all relevant information and samples; and must operate with transparency and independent oversight. Without these features, it will not be credible, trustworthy, or effective”. Allowing the publication of scientific research into all possible origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is urgently required.

The articles, pre-prints and blogs below are gouped into sections: preprints by PhD scientists currently working at a University or biochemical institution. 2) Articles and log posts by anonymous authors who demonstrate a high level of knowledge of biochemistry.
