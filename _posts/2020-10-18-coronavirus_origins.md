# Coronavirus origins

## Why consider a synthetic origin for SARS-CoV-2?

There are three factors that when considered together, lead to the plausible theory (likely I would argue) that the SARS-C0V-2 genome was engineered at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).

1) The WIV is the worlds leading research center for coronavirus research (and specifically betacoronaviruses) and has been actively engaged in gain of function applied research since at least [2008](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/4/1899.full.pdf)

2) The WIV is located ~12km from the Huanan Seafood Market which early in the Covid-19 outbreak was thought to be the epicenter of amplification of the outbreak.

3) No animal has been as yet identified to be the source of zoonotic transfer of the disease to humans. While it took [7 months to identify masked palm civets as potentially playing a role in transmission of SARS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7114516/) less was known in 2003 about coronaviruses, their natural origin and the role of intermediate species in their spread. 

3) The peculiarities of the SARS-CoV-2 genome: It appears to be remarkably well adapted to humans (Jia et al. 2020, Piplani et al. 2020, Sørensen et al. 2020, Zhan et al, 2020,,); it contains a furin cleavage site not found in SARS-CoV-related coronaviruses (Hoffman, 2020); and [anomalous S-Protein amino acid sequence patterns when compared with related betacoronaviruses.](https://nerdhaspower.weebly.com/).

The most common paper I have seen cited to support a natural origin theory for CARS-CoV-2 is by [Anderson et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9). The first argument the authors make in support of a natural origin is that based on computational analysis, the binding of SARS-C0V-2 to human ACE2 is not ideal and that “this is strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is not the product of purposeful manipulation”. I would counter with the question, why must synthetic viruses created in laboratories ideally bind to human receptors? Anderson et. al. then argue that ”the genetic data irrefutably show that SARS-CoV-2 is not derived from any previously used virus backbone”. Firstly arguments by [Nerd](https://nerdhaspower.weebly.com/) and [Sørensen, et al.](https://www.minervanett.no/files/2020/07/13/TheEvidenceNoNaturalEvol.pdf) counter the ‘irrefutable’ claim and secondly, we do not know how viruses the WIV have sampled and sequenced and not publicly released. The RaTG13 genome for example (the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2), was sequenced in 2018 and was not released until [May 2020](https://db.cngb.org/search/experiment/SRX8357956/) well after the COVID-19 pandemic had first started in Wuhan. 
In a third argument Anderson et al. write “if genetic manipulation had been performed, one of the several reverse-genetic systems available for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used” and quote a paper [co-authored by none other than Zheng-Li Shi](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30531947/).

Given the weak arguments in such a widely cited paper used to ‘disprove’ the ‘synthetic origin myth’, it is unclear to me why a natural origin for SARS-CoV-2 cannot be questioned.

Below I outline the history of coronavirus research, work by the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the outbreak of COVID-19 and include brief summaries of papers and articles questioning the natural origin theory. Given the seriousness of this pandemic I hope the references below will serve as a starting point for you to conduct your own research into the origin of SARS-CoV-2

Terminology: SARS-CoV-2 (in some early papers called 'Wuhan CoV') is the viral cause of covid-19; Some papers use the name Dr. Zheng-Li Shi, others Dr. Zhengli Shi, these refer to the same person; WIV is an abbreviation for the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

## Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)

The only P4 (high security lab) in China is in Wuhan (two in Taiwan), and is located several hundred meters to a few kilometers (I have seen reports vary from 280m to 12km) away from the suspected outbreak [epicenter](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338993642_A_new_coronavirus_associated_with_human_respiratory_disease_in_China) the Wuhan wet market (though the this association may have been recently [discounted](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/340924249_Is_considering_a_genetic-manipulation_origin_for_SARS-CoV-2_a_conspiracy_theory_that_must_be_censored)). Until last week I had not done any research into the WIV. 

1. The WIV, mainland China's highest security virology lab is situated within a few kilometers of the coronavirus outbreak epicenter in the Wuhan wet market.
2. The WIV is a leading center for coronavirus research in China.
3. A leading WIV virologist Dr. Zhengli Shi was the author of the a paper in 2020 claiming to have discovered the RaTG13 coronavirus in 2013, which is the most closely related coronavirus to SARS-CoV-2 (cause of Covid-19).

## Chronology

### SARS

Several papers discussing coronaviruses and [SARS](https://www.cdc.gov/sars/about/fs-sars.html) are outlined below. It is interesting to review the history of research of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Note that [chimeric fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_protein) experiments were carried out in multiple labs worldwide (including the WIV) post SARS / pre-Covid-19 period.

December 2006. [Review of Bats and SARS](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/12/12/pdfs/06-0401.pdf) by Wang, L-F et al. (incl. Zhengli Shi). The authors discuss the role of civets in transmission of SARS-CoV to humans and "sequence analyses indicated the existence of a much greater genetic diversity of SARS-like–CoVs in bats than of SARS-CoVs in civets or humans, which supports the notion that SARS-CoV is a member of this novel coronavirus group and that bats are a natural reservoir for it.". Furthermore "For the SARS-like–CoVs to infect humans, substantial genetic changes in the S1 receptor-binding domain will be necessary."

2007 [Bats, Civets and the Emergence of SARS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17848070/) by Wang, L.F. and Eaton, B.T.

19th December 2007. [Mechanisms of Zoonotic Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Host Range Expansion in Human Airway Epithelium](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/5/2274.full.pdf) by Sheahan T. et al. The authors describe “the synthetic construction and characterization of a SARS-CoV chimera bearing a zoonotic SZ16 S protein” and produce a pseudo-virus capable of binding to human airway epithelial cells.

18th August 2008. [Synthetic recombinant bat SARS-like coronavirus is infectious in cultured cells and in mice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2588415/pdf/zpq19944.pdf) by Becker M. et al. The authors show a method to replace an RBD in a bat coronavirus with a SARS RBD to test a possible route of emergence to humans.

February 2008. [Difference in Receptor Usage between Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus and SARS-Like Coronavirus of Bat Origin](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/4/1899.full.pdf) by Ren W. et al. (incl. Zhengli Shi). the authors modify the S protein of SL-CoV by replacing the RBD with that from the SARS-CoV S to show the hybrid protein was able to use the huACE2 for cell entry.

18th September 2009. [Immunogenicity difference between the SARS coronavirus and the bat SARS-like coronavirus spike (S) proteins](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19595990/) by Zhou, P. et al. (incl. Zhengli Shi) In a joint study between WIV and CSIRO (Australia), the researchers undertake pseudo-virus immunization studies focusing on S-protein constructs "The replacement of the sequence from aa 310–518 alone almost completely abolished the bat antibody reactivity towards the SSL protein."

**21st April 2010 [Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) proteins of different bat species confer variable susceptibility to SARS-CoV entry](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20567988/) by Hou, Y. et al. (incl Zhengli Shi).** The authors undertook chimeric ACE2 construction, combining "the N-terminal region of bat ACE2 with the C-terminal portion of human ACE2"

29 August 2013 [Receptor recognition and cross-species infections of SARS coronavirus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3840050/pdf/main.pdf) by Fang Li. This paper includes a good description of coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. "SARS-CoV infects a wide variety of animal species, including humans, palm civets, monkeys, domestic cats, ferrets, hamsters, raccoon dogs, and bats. It is believed that bats harbor the precursors of SARS-CoV and thus are the natural reservoir for the virus. In addition, palm civets played a key role in the spread of SARS-CoV to humans and thus were the interim reservoir or amplifying host for the virus"."The binding interactions between SARS-CoV RBD and ACE2 largely determine the host range and cross-species infections of SARS-CoV and hence are the focus of this review"

30th October 2013 [Isolation and characterization of a bat SARS-like coronavirus that uses the ACE2 receptor](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12711), Xing-Yi Ge et al. (incl. Zhengli Shi). "Here we report whole-genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats (family: Rhinolophidae) in Yunnan, China: RsSHC014 and Rs3367. These viruses are far more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat coronaviruses, particularly in the receptor binding domain of the spike protein. Most importantly, we report the first recorded isolation of a live SL-CoV (bat SL-CoV-WIV1) from bat faecal samples in Vero E6 cells, which has typical coronavirus morphology, 99.9% sequence identity to Rs3367 and uses ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry."

Nature Correspondence ["The proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9) by Andersen, A. et al. conclude "Our analyses clearly show that SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus." by Andersen et. al. A key dataset used to draw conclusions on was RaTG13 "Indeed, the availability of the RaTG13 bat sequence helped reveal key RBD mutations and the polybasic cleavage site.". "Although RaTG13, sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat1, is ~96% identical overall to SARS-CoV-2, its spike diverges in the RBD, which suggests that it may not bind efficiently to human ACE27".

Moreover, we do a critical analysis of the paper of Andersen and colleagues published in Nature on the Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2. This paper is considered to prove that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural origin, but in our opinion it lacks scientific evidence.".

**16th April 2020. [Evidence SARS-CoV-2 Emerged From a Biological Laboratory in Wuhan, China](https://project-evidence.github.io/)** these anonymous authors show a high level of knowledge in biochemical research and biosecurity standards. They infer it highly likely the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the WIV or plausibly the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control "In order for this pandemic to have originated outside of a Wuhan biological laboratory, the following would have had to take place:
- An unknown animal comes into contact with a bat carrying the virus that would become SARS-CoV-2. This bat, for some reason, is not hibernating during the winter unlike most other bats.
- This animal is then hunted and killed by some unknown person who does not fall ill and does not spread SARS-CoV-2 to anyone else.
- This animal is then sent from its original location to the Huanan Seafood Market. Along the way, it is handled by dozens to hundreds of transportation employees, all of whom do not get sick and do not spread the virus.
- The animal finally reaches the market, at which point multiple people who encounter it are hospitalized, and the virus begins to spread at very high rates."

(Immunor and St Georges, University of London).** The authors undertake a detailed study of the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike and identify multiple characteristics that strongly suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was purposefully synthetically manipulated in a laboratory. “Five salient features that strengthen the case for purposeful(sic) manipulation in the laboratory” are: 1) A major part of the spike protein has human-like domains with matured transmission adaption; 2) The Spike displays new amino acid inserts with condensed cumulative charge, all of which are surface exposed; 3) The concentration of positive charge is on the receptor binding domain near the receptor binding motif at the top of the Spike protein; 4) The Spike is so configured that it can bind to cell tissue without use of the ACE2 receptor; 5) Anomalous CLEC4M attachment receptor.

In this piece, the authors find several anomalous features of the SARS-CoV-2 when compared with other betacoronavirues "SARS-CoV-2 host tropism/adaptation pattern has significant discrepancies compared to other CoVs, raising questions concerning the proximal origin of SARS-CoV-2. The flat and non-sunken surface of the sialic acid-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S protein) conflicts with the general adaptation and survival pattern observed for all other CoVs. Unlike RaTG13, SARS-CoV-2 recombination presumably occurred between the S1/S2 domains of S protein enabling host furin protease utilization. Although millions of recorded cases have been recorded globally, SARS-CoV-2 S protein does not have any apparent further recombination, placing it in conflict with the recombination models of other CoVs.  Similarly, the S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2  has not accumulated high-frequency  non-synonymous substitutions, differentiating SARS-CoV-2 from other CoVs that have positive selection/adaptation mutations in their RBDs."

3rd November 2020. Opinion piece ["Opinion: To stop the next pandemic, we need to unravel the origins of COVID-19"](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/11/03/2021133117) by Relman, D. (Stanford University School of Medicine). The author (bravely (sic)) questions the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 and considers three possible origins (natural zoonitic; collected and stored in lab and perhaps manipulated genetically and accidentally released; laboratory manipulated and deliberately released) to the virus and emphasizes the importance of identifying which of the three scenarios actually occurred.

## Conclusions

1) The conclusions below are my own, based on a review of the evidence cited above.
2) To make your own informed conclusion at minimum a review of the key articles in **bold** font above is recommended. 

There are several factors that have changed my thinking on the origin of Covid-19:

### Location

If we assume a high population density is associated with increased risk of zoonotic transmission and spread, we can say take the ~250 cities in China with a population [> 500,000 people](http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf) as having increased risk of a coronavirus outbreak (If we relax this assumption, we could include tens of thousands of towns and villages). Out of all these cities, the location where the Covid-19 outbreak occurred was hundreds of meters to several kilometers away from the WIV where Dr. Zhengli Shi registered the RaTG13 genome sequence which is the closest known bat coronavirus to Covid-19.

This is an incredible coincidence and I haven't seen any statistical analysis on the likelihood of this coincidence.

### SARS-CoV-2 relatives

There are 4 coronavirus sequences most closely related to SARS-CoV-2. 

* RaTG13 published in 2020 but has not been independently verified.
* MP789 isolated in a Malaysian Pangolin in 2019
* bat-SL-CoVZXC21 identified and owned by the Institute of Military Medicine Nanjing Command
* bat-SL-CoVZC45 identified and owned by the Institute of Military Medicine Nanjing Command

That the RaTG13 coronavirus genome sequence has "never been isolated or cultured" and "we have only the genome sequence" (see 31st July 2020. Reply to Science Magazine questions by Dr Zhengli Shi) raises real questions as to the validity of this genome sequence.

The report [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4073131) raises questions as to the validity of the methods used in MP789 Pangolin studies. Also looking at the potential for transmission of viruses to humans, Malay Pangolins appear to be an unlikely source: ~10,000 per year are illegally trapped and exported to China and Vietnam. Of those only a certain percentage will be infected, [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.19.158717v1) did not find any evidence of coronaviruses in a 10 year study of Pangolins in Malaysia, so the percentage should be very small (any infection presumably occurred in transit).

That the CoVZXC21 and CoVZC45 were discovered and controlled by the Chinese military and are relatively closely related to SARS-CoV-2 is another interesting factor to be taken into consideration when investigating a potential synthetic origin for the virus.

### Gene sequencing

Significant anomalies as to the SARS-CoV-2 genome have been raised by Yan. L. et al. "SARS-CoV-2 Is an Unrestricted Bioweapon", Segreto. R. and Deigin, Y. "Is considering a genetic-manipulation origin for SARS-CoV-2 a conspiracy theory that must be censored?" and "Nerd". "Scientific evidence and logic behind the claim that the Wuhan coronavirus is man-made". 

The Zhengli Shi's team at the WIV was actively engaged in [chimeric fusion experiments](https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/82/4/1899.full.pdf) where they created pseudo-viruses by replacing the RBD of a the S protein of a bat coronavirus SL-CoV by with that from the SARS-CoV Spike protein RBD to show the hybrid protein was able to use the hACE2 for cell entry.

### Final Conclusions

#### 1) Did the virus leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)?

Given: the highly coincidental location of the WIV within a few kilometers of the suspected epicenter the breakout; that the WIV was actively engaged in collection, study and genetic manipulation of bat coronaviruses; lack of association of the first documented Covid-19 cases with the Wuhan seafood market lead me to conclude a WIV lab leak is **very likely**.

#### 2) Was the SARS-CoV-2 genome synthetically manipulated?

The documented history of coronavirus research and synthetic manipulation of coronaviruses by the WIV; anomalous nature of the RaTG13 genome and questionable Pangolin virus study methodology; and PLA military ties to ZXC21 and ZC45 which appear highly correlated to the SARS-CoV-2 genome except in the important S protein areas, lead me to conclude a synthetic origin is **likely**.

#### 3) Was the virus intentionally released as a bioweapon?

That the epicenter of the virus was located in the vicinity of the WIV where research into the most closely related genomes to SARS-CoV-2 (most advanced research of anywhere in the world) was conducted, an intentional release in Wuhan would raise too much suspicion. Also the Chinese government would have been better prepared for the outbreak if a release was planned. I conclude that an intentional release is **unlikely**.


In my opinion there is enough evidence to pressure scientific journals to allow the publication of investigations into 1) the possibility of laboratory leak and 2) a synthetic origin for the SARS-CoV-2 genome.
