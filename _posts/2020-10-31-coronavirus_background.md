# Coronavirus history


## Introduction

After writing my [Coronavirus origins post](https://humblescientist.github.io/2020/10/18/coronavirus_origins.html), I found that people would skim through the post and quickly make a conclusion based on per-conceived ideas. In this post I look at the history of coronavirus research prior to the outbreak of Covid-19 in late 2019. Given the number of infections (~45 million) and deaths (~1.2 million as at 31st Oct) I would encourage you to spend a few days (yes it will take days) reading the research papers in this and my previous post in detail.

In this post I make no inference whatsoever, I just provide summaries, research data and references to the papers I have summarised. All papers were published prior to November 2019, and provide a immutable timestamp of the state of coronavirus research prior to Covid-19.

This post is work in progress :-)

## Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are termed as such because of the distinct perturbations they have, forming crown or 'corona' like features.

## SARS

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic broke-out in 2002–2003 in southern China, and spread to other regions of Asia and also to Europe and North America (Lee et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004). It caused more than 8000 infections worldwide with an approximately 10% fatality rate (Li, F. 2013)

## Spike (S) protein

The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV), a type I transmembrane envelope glycoprotein, consists of S1 and S2 domains which are responsible for virus binding, fusion and entry.

S1 is responsible for virus binding to the receptor on the target cells.

## RBD

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) is a immunogenic fragment of a virus that binds to a specific endogenous receptor sequence to gain entry into host cells. It is a critical part of the virus that allows membrane fusion and delivery to the cytoplasm. In SARS coronaviruses the RBD is located in the middle region of S1 (Fig n below) (Babcock, G.J. 2004, He, Y. et al. 2004)

## ACE2

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the receptor on target cells that the S1 RBD binds to.
